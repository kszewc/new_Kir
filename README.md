# new_Kir
This repository contains all the data and scripts necessary to replicate the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and analyze the results for different types of Kir6 channels. The data includes input files for running the simulations and analysis scripts to process the data.
The simulations were performed using GROMACS, systems were prepared using CHARMM-GUI. The resulting trajectories were analyzed using custom Python scripts.
